# cognate-classifier

Small PyTorch project I worked in to identify cognates in Spanish and English
* Uses LMST neural network on character embeddings for words
* Uses standard sigmoid activation with BCELoss
* Trains from a dataset I organized which includes 73 non-cognate pairs and 87 cognate pairs
